# WebPulse




# Project Idea

WebPulse is a local app built using WPF and .NET, designed to keep users updated on content like TV series episodes, e-books, mangas, and similar types of media. The app offers a flexible approach to monitoring content across a wide range of websites, including small, unknown, and even less reliable sites. This is made possible by allowing users to set up monitoring tasks in ways that best fit their needs.

When setting up a monitoring task, users can choose between two options:

1. Provide a URL and specify the variable part of the URL (e.g., the dynamic episode number).
2. Supply JavaScript code that WebPulse can run to change the page, such as triggering a "Next" button to navigate.

At its core, WebPulse uses the Puppeteer library to perform web scraping, allowing it to fetch and track content updates from the specified websites. This approach ensures that users can monitor a wide variety of online content with minimal effort, regardless of how the website is structured.

# Contributions

The core functions of WebPulse is finally done, yet the app isn't. With only using the app for mere second will you find stuff that needs to be worked on. 
A wise wizard man once said "Contributions is what makes open source great". 
Here are some contribution examples you can work on:

1. Ugly Hover affects on multiple ui components.
2. Save user settings and use them on load.
3. Generally any UI improvements is appreciated. 
4. Make the white version of the close, minimize, window buttons and make them work. 
5. You can make the tutorial playground website where the user can learn how to use the app.
6. User notifications when a release is found. And a link directly to the resource. 
Note: Nearly all of these issues have a solid foundation to work on and/or even direct examples to how to solve. it 

Extra: Remember to make your own personal theme resource and make it a theme option 😉
